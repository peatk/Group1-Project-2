# Book Bans In The US 


### Project Overview

Our project delved into an analysis of banned books within the United States educational system, aiming to shed light on the concerning trend of book bans in public schools. Drawing from data provided by PEN America's Index of School Book Bans, covering bans from July 2021 to March 2022, we explored the scope and implications of book censorship in educational settings. Utilizing data visualization tools such as JavaScript, Leaflet, and heatmaps, we aimed to offer a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon.

### Key Findings and Insights

Our analysis revealed alarming trends in the prevalence and nature of book bans across various school districts in the United States. Over the nine-month period covered, a total of 1,586 instances of individual books being banned were recorded, affecting 1,145 unique book titles. These bans manifested in different forms, including removals from school libraries, prohibitions in classrooms, and restrictions during investigations prompted by challenges from parents, educators, administrators, or lawmakers. Particularly troubling was the finding that the vast majority of bans (98%) deviated from established best practice guidelines designed to protect students' First Amendment rights. Additionally, the data showcased a disproportionate targeting of books by or about marginalized communities, including people of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, and persons with disabilities, underscoring concerns about censorship and representation in school curricula. Through our visualization efforts, we aimed to amplify awareness of these trends and advocate for the preservation of free expression and access to diverse literature in educational environments.

### Database
Our raw data came from an excel (.xlsx) file. We chose PostgreSQL as our database which offers structured data management, efficient querying, scalability, and data integrity. These benefits facilitate data storage, management, analysis, and ensure the consistency, security, and reliability of the stored data compared to the raw .xlsx file.

### Ethical Considerations

Transparency regarding the criteria and motivations behind book bans is crucial for fostering informed debate and safeguarding intellectual freedom. Additionally, ethical frameworks should prioritize the promotion of diversity and inclusion, recognizing that censorship disproportionately impacts marginalized voices and perpetuates systemic biases. Ultimately, any analysis of book ban data must be guided by a commitment to upholding democratic principles and protecting the rights of all individuals to engage with a wide range of ideas and perspectives.
